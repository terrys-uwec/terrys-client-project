                <h2>OVERVIEW OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE</h2>
                <p>Suthy Screams is the scariest Haunted House you will find on all of campus. It is also the only one on campus (Priory has a great one off-campus, check it out)! Suthy Screams is run by the Sutherland Hall Council every year, and typically takes place on the Friday and Saturday closest to Halloween. The event goes through the entirety of Sutherland's basement. Each room is decorated with a different theme from the last, and every year hundreds of visitors go through the basement, but only some can actually figure out Sutherland's layout.</p>

                <h2>HISTORY OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE</h2>
                <p>While there isn't much information about how long Sutherland has been running this Haunted House, there is a video from 2013 showing off the house, as well as older undated group photos of the scare actors. The house didn't run in 202 due to the pandemic, however it was brought back in 2021 and has just been getting scarier since!</p>
